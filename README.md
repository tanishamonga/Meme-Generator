# Meme-Generator
The meme generator code integrates multiple tools and technologies including Google Colab for cloud-based execution, PIL for image manipulation, Matplotlib for image display, Transformers (GPT-2) for AI-based caption generation, and Ipywidgets for interactive UI creation. This combination allows users to generate and customize memes with both manual and AI-generated captions.
